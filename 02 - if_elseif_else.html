  /*
  Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.
  
  You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.
  
  In JavaScript, there are three forms of the if...else statement.
  
      if statement
      if...else statement
      if...else if...else statement
      
      Use 'if' to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
      Use 'else' to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
      Use 'else if' to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
  
  -------------------------------------------
  The 'if' Statement
  Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.
  The if statement executes a statement if a specified condition is truthy. 
  If the condition is falsy, another statement in the optional else clause will be executed.
  
  if (condition) {
    //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
  } 
  
  Example:
  Make a "Good day" greeting if the hour is less than 18:00:
  
  let hour = 13
  if (hour < 18) {
    greeting = "Good day";
  } 
  
  -------------------------------------------
  The 'else' Statement
  Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
  
  if (condition) {
    //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
  } else {
    //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
  }
  
  Example:
  If the hour is less than 18, create a "Good day" greeting, otherwise "Good evening":
  
  let hour = 20
  if (hour < 18) {
    greeting = "Good day";
  } else {
    greeting = "Good evening";
  }
  
  -------------------------------------------
  The else if Statement
  Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
  
  if (condition1) {
    //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
  } else if (condition2) {
    //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
  } else {
    //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
  }
  
  Example:
  If time is less than 10:00, create a "Good morning" greeting, if not, but time is less than 20:00, create a "Good day" greeting, otherwise a "Good evening":
  
  let time = 20
  if (time < 10) {
    greeting = "Good morning";
  } else if (time < 20) {
    greeting = "Good day";
  } else {
    greeting = "Good evening";
  }

  Task 4 *
  -------
  In this task we will learn about if-elseif-else statement.
  As a base for the task we will declare and initialize some variables to use them later.
  The task itself is about simulating a fight between two pokemon.
  
  * Declare two variables with the pokemons name.
  * Declare 2 variables the health of the pokemons.
  * Declare 2 variables the attack-power of the pokemons.
  * We gives you a random number generator for a variable which will decide at the begining
    that which pokemon starts the fight. Result 0 mean first pokemon is faster and 1 mean second pokemon start.
