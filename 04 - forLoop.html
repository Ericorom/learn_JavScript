    What is a loop?
    -------------------------------
    A loop is a control flow statement that is used to execute a block of code over and over again until the condition given in the loop is true.
    In simple words, a loop is a block of code that is executed over and over again until a condition is met. The condition is called a loop condition and it is given in the loop.
    
    Why do we use loops?
    -------------------------------
    The most common use of loops is to repeat a block of code a number of times.

    The syntax of the for loop
    -------------------------------
    for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
        // code block to be executed
    }

    ↓↓↓

    * Initialization is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block. 
    
    * Condition defines the condition for executing the code block. It is a statement that returns true or false, 
      and if the condition is true then the code block of the loop body is executed, if the condition is false then the loop breaks.
    
    * Iteration is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed. In this part, the counter of for loop is updated.

    Loops are very useful while programming, it is one of the most used features of any programming language.
    For example, if we want to print "Hello, World!" 10 times then instead of writing printing code for 10 times we can use a loop and write the code once:
    */
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log((i + 1) + '- Hello World!')
    }

    /*
    Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
    Often this is the case when working with arrays.

    For example, instead of writing the code below:
        text += cars[0] + "<br>";
        text += cars[1] + "<br>";
        text += cars[2] + "<br>";
        text += cars[3] + "<br>";
        text += cars[4] + "<br>";
        text += cars[5] + "<br>";

    Just use a for loop...
    */
    const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford", "Fiat", "Audi"];
    let text = "";
    for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
        text= text + cars[i] + ", ";
        console.log(text)
    }
    console.log(text)

    /*
    JavaScript Infinite for loop
    -------------------------------

    If the test condition in a for loop is always true, it runs forever (until memory is full). 
    For example:

    for(let i = 1; i > 0; i++) {
        // block of code
    }

    In the above program, the condition is always true which will then run the code for infinite times.
    
    !!! We always have to try avoid infinite loops !!!

    /*
    How to Break or Continue a For Loop Operation
    ---------------------------------------------
    So far, we have seen how to create a for loop, but it’s also important to mention that we can break out of a loop using break. 
    The break statement is used to terminate the loop immediately when it is encountered.
    */

    for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        if (i == 5) {
            break;
        }
        console.log(i);
    }

    /*
    The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.
    In this example skips the value of 3:
    */
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (i === 3) {
            continue;
        }
        text = "The number is " + i;
        console.log(text)
    }


    /*
    Nested for loop in javascript
    -------------------------------
    You can use for loop inside another for loop. This is called nested for loop.
    Nested loops are useful when you want to loop through a list of items and then do something with each item. 
    For example, you want to loop through a list of numbers and perform a series of operations on each number.
    Nested loop example: 
    */
    
    for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        console.log('i = ' + i)
        for (var j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            console.log(i + "-" + j);
        }
    }
    

    /*
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Types of loops in javascript
 
    JavaScript has various different kinds of loops. Here is a list of them.
 
    * for loop: Loop that repeats a block of code for a specified number of times. 

    * for...in: Loop that repeats a block of code for each property of an object. 
        The for...in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object. It is also used to iterate over an array.

    * for...of: Loop that is used to loop through iterable like Array, String, etc
        The for...of loop is used to iterate over the elements of an array. It is also used to iterate over an iterable object like an array, strings, NodeList, arguments, etc.

    * while: A loop that repeats a block of code while a given condition is true. 
        See it in next tutorial.

    * do...while: This also execute a block of code until a given condition is true but it executes the block of code at least once. 
        See it in next tutorial.
