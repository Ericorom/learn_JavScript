    DECLARE a variable

    Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable. 
        Example:
            let carName;

    The general rules for declare names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
        Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
        Names must begin with a letter.
        Names can also begin with $ and _ .
        Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
        Reserved words (like JavaScript, let, const, function ...etc keywords) cannot be used as names.

    In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, 
    or something that will be provided later, like user input.
    A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.
        Example:
            let carName;
            console.log(carName)  -> it will be 'undefind'

    You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.
        Example (this will not work):
            let carName = "Volvo";
            let carName;
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ASSIGN / INITIALIZE a variable

    After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).

    To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign (=)
        Example:
            carName = "Volvo";

    You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it:
        Example:
            let carName = "Volvo";

    You can declare many variables in one statement.
    Start the statement with 'let' and separate the variables by comma.
        Example:
            let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
    
    But the best practice is declare variables in multiple lines:
        Example:
            let person = "John Doe"
            let carName = "Volvo",
            let price = 200;
    
    Change a variable
    Once you initialize a variable, you can change its value by assigning a different value. 
        Example:
            let message = "Hello";
            message = 'Bye';
            console.log(message) -> it will display 'Bye'

    Types of primitive variables:
        let myvariable = 1;  // numeric value
        let myvariable = 1.1; // decimal value
        let myvariable = 'one'; // string value
        let myvariable = true; // Boolean value
        let myvariable = null; // null value
    
    A constant holds a value that doesnâ€™t change. To declare a constant, you use the const keyword. 
    When defining a constant, you need to initialize it with a value. 
        Example:
            const workday = 5;

    Points to Remember

    * Variable stores data value that can be changed later on.
    * Variables can be defined using let, var, const keyword.
    * Variables must be initialized before accessing it.
    * Multiple variables can be defined in a single line separated by a comma. But it is not a good practice.
    * JavaScript is a loosely-typed language, so a variable can store any type value.
    * Variable names are case-sensitive.
    * Variable names can contain letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _. It cannot start with a digit 0 - 9.

    /*
    Task 1
    ------
    In this task we want you to:
        1 - Declare a variable called myName.
        2 - Initialize myName with a suitable value, on a separate line (you can use your actual name, or something else).
        3 - Declare a variable called myAge and initialize it with a value, on the same line.
    */
    let myName 
    myName = "Ericorom"
    let myAge = 8.7


    /*
    Task 2
    ------
    In this task you need to add a new line to correct the value stored in the existing 'my_Name' variable to your own name.
    */
    let my_Name = 'Paul';
    my_Name = 'Ericorom'
    console.log(my_Name)
    
    
    /*
    Task 3
    ------
    In this task you need to concat (add) the first tree variable to make a correct sentence and assign that to the variable 'result'.
    */
    let variableOne = 'when my code '
    let variableTwo = 'I am happy '
    let variableThree = 'finally works! '

    let result
    result = variableTwo + variableOne + variableThree

    console.log(result)


    /*
    Task 4
    ------

    In a restaurant the waitress want to write a program to sum the customers bill at end of the evening faster.
    But at the same time he wants to get some useful information based on data he knows.
    Help him in this task. 
    See what data he can share with you:
    He knows the price of the drinks and foods and that how many people ordered food or drink. 
    Also he knows how many table is in the restaurant and how many customer visited the restaurant this evening.
    
    * He telling you there is 5 table.
    * The food price is 15 euro.
    * The drink price is 3 euro.
    * He remembers 55 people visited the restaurant and everybody ordered at least food or drink.
    * From 55 customer 27 ordered food.
    * From 55 customer 38 ordered drink.

    Answer the following questions:
    -------------------------------
    1 - How much the customers paid for all drink?
    2 - How much the customers paid for all food?
    3 - How much the customers paid for both food and drink?
    4 - How many customers ordered both food and drink?
    5 - How much those customers paid overall who ordered both drink and food?
    6 - How much was the average food-consumption per table?

    Write your code below to calculate/get these informations.
    */
    console.log()

    const TABLES = 5
    const PRICE_FOOD = 15
    const PRICE_DRINK = 3
    const PEOPLE = 55
    const FOOD_ORDER = 27
    const DRINK_ORDER = 38

    let all_drink_price
    all_drink_price = DRINK_ORDER * PRICE_DRINK

    console.log('Answer of Question ' + 1 + ' : ' + all_drink_price + ' euro.')
    // console.log(`Answer of Question 1 '' "" : ${all_drink_price} euro.`)

    let all_food_price
    all_food_price  = FOOD_ORDER * PRICE_FOOD

    console.log('Answer of Question ' + 2 + ' : ' + all_food_price + ' euro.')
    
    console.log('Answer of Question ' + 3 + ' : ' + (all_drink_price + all_food_price) + ' euro.')

    let both_food_drink = (FOOD_ORDER + DRINK_ORDER) - PEOPLE

    console.log('Answer of Question ' + 4 + ' : ' + both_food_drink + ' people.')
